# NanzMusify

A web music player backed by YouTube Music search/streaming, packaged for
one-click deployment on **Netlify**.

## Project structure

```
public/                    -> static site (Netlify "publish" directory)
api/                        -> original handler logic (req, res) — shared source
netlify/functions/          -> thin Netlify Function wrappers around api/*.js (JSON endpoints)
netlify/edge-functions/     -> Edge Function for audio streaming
netlify.toml                -> Netlify build & routing configuration
server.js                   -> plain Express server, used only for local dev (npm run dev)
```

No build step is required — the site is plain HTML/CSS/JS. On Netlify the
backend runs entirely as Netlify Functions / Edge Functions; locally it runs
through `server.js` (or `netlify dev`, which matches production behavior).

## Deploy to Netlify

### Option A — Netlify CLI
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Option B — Git integration
1. Push this repository to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
2. In Netlify: **Add new site → Import an existing project**.
3. Build settings are already defined in `netlify.toml` (publish = `public`,
   functions = `netlify/functions`) — no changes needed.
4. Deploy.

### Option C — Drag & drop
Zip the whole project folder (including `netlify.toml`, `netlify/`, `api/`
and `public/`) and drag it onto the Netlify dashboard deploy area.

No environment variables are required.

## API routes

| Route                | Backend                                                           |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/api/search`         | Netlify Function (`netlify/functions/search.js`)                 |
| `/api/lyrics`         | Netlify Function                                                  |
| `/api/artist`         | Netlify Function                                                  |
| `/api/album`          | Netlify Function                                                  |
| `/api/suggest`        | Netlify Function                                                  |
| `/api/ytplay`         | Netlify Function                                                  |
| `/api/transcribe`     | Netlify Function (also used internally by `/api/lyrics`)         |
| `/api/proxy-audio`    | **Edge Function** (streams audio bytes, with Range/206 support)  |

`proxy-audio` runs as an Edge Function instead of a regular Function:
regular (Lambda-based) functions buffer the whole response in memory with a
small payload limit, which breaks long-track playback / seeking. Favicon is
static — `/logo.png` on every page, including `/play/:videoId`.

## Local development
```bash
npm run dev        # plain Express server, matches api/*.js exactly
# or
npx netlify dev    # runs the static site + Functions + Edge Functions locally
```
